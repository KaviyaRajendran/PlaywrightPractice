# PlaywrightPractice
- Learning Playwright to upskill my automation knowledge
  
Environment setup
  - Java
  - Maven
  - Eclipse IDE

WHY PLAYWRIGHT?
- Cross browser testing -> executes in browser engines -> chromium, Blink (Google), Webkit(Safari), Gecko (Firefox)
- Cross platform - All OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) -> both head and headless
- Language - Java, Javascript, node.js, python
- Test mobile web
- No flaky test ( runs on local, fails on pipeline) using Auto wait
- Web first assertions ( isdisplayed? -> wait for some time and give error)
- Tracing
- Events (Click, hover, drag and drop, controls, page load, DOM)
- Frame support, Shadow DOM
- Full isolation and fast execution (no intermediate like Chrome driver), so it is fast
- Browser contexts (At a time, multiple applications)
- Storage state (cookies)
- Codegen - record sequence of tests
- Playwright inspector -> debugging
- Trace viewer -> Dom test execution snapshot, test source
